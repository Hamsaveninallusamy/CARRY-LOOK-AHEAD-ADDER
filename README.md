# CARRY-LOOK-AHEAD-ADDER
This repository includes the RTL and testbench code for a 4-bit Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA). The Carry Look-Ahead Adder is known for its ability to speed up binary addition by pre-calculating carry bits, thereby minimizing propagation delays. The CarryLookAheadAdder module takes two 4-bit inputs (A_in and B_in) and a carry-in bit (Cin_in), producing a 4-bit sum (Sum_out) and a carry-out bit (Cout_out). The testbench (TB) is designed to validate the adder's functionality by applying various input combinations and monitoring the outputs. The results, which display the Sum_out, Cout_out, and combined Addition_out, provide a comprehensive check of the adder's performance. This setup ensures efficient and accurate binary addition.
